# Chat Name Colorizer
This is my first Minecraft Spigot plugin which allows users to set the color of their name in chat.  It was developed for version 1.18. 

Settings will be persisted in the config.yml file in the plugins directory for your Spigot server.

## Commands
__/chatcolor <color>__

This command will set the color of your name in chat.  

__/chatcolors__

This command will list all of the supported colors
